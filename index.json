Ten healthy subjects consumed a fast food (FF) and a Mediterranean (Med) diet for 4 days in randomized order, with a 4-day wash-out between treatments. A multiple reaction monitoring method was used to characterize the site-specific glycoprofiles of HDL proteins, and HDL functional capacity was analyzed. We describe for the first time that ApoE has 7 mucin-type O-glycosylation sites, which were not affected by short-term diet. The glycoprofiles of other HDL-associated proteins were also unaffected, except that a disialylated ApoC-III glycan was enriched after Med diet, and a nonsialylated ApoC-III glycan was enriched after FF diet. Twenty-five individual glycopeptides were significantly correlated with cholesterol efflux capacity and 21 glycopeptides were correlated with immunomodulatory capacity. Results from this study indicate that the glycoprofiles of HDL-associated proteins including ApoE are correlated with HDL functional capacity but generally unaffected by diet in the short term, except ApoC-III sialylation. These results suggest that HDL protein glycoprofiles are affected by both acute and long-term factors and may be useful for biomarker discovery.","tags":[],"title":"Site-Specific Glycoprofiles of HDL-Associated ApoE are Correlated with HDL Functional Capacity and Unaffected by Short-Term Diet","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chenghao Zhu","Lisa Sawrey-Kubicek","Elizabeth Beals","Riley L Hughes","Chris H Rhodes","Romina Sacchi","Angela M Zivkovic"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1566000000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566000000,"objectID":"8cc6b2f7d9f0c60e4446ba1d017b8179","permalink":"https://www.chenghaozhu.net/cv/publication/zhu-2019-ffs-lipidome/","publishdate":"2019-08-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/cv/publication/zhu-2019-ffs-lipidome/","section":"publication","summary":"**INTRODUCTION:** HDL is associated with increased longevity and protection from multiple chronic diseases. The major HDL protein ApoA-I has a half-life of about 4 days, however, the effects of diet on the composition of HDL particles at this time scale have not been studied. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to investigate the short term dietary effect on HDL lipidomic composition.\n**METHODS:** In this randomized order cross-over study, ten healthy subjects consumed a Mediterranean (Med) and a fast food (FF) diet for 4 days, with a 4-day wash-out between treatments. Lipidomic composition was analyzed in isolated HDL fractions by an untargeted LC-MS method with 15 internal standards.\n**RESULTS:** HDL phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) content was increased by FF diet, and 41 out of 170 lipid species were differentially affected by diet. Saturated fatty acids (FAs) and odd chain FA were enriched after FF diet, while very-long chain FA and unsaturated FA were enriched after Med diet. The composition of phosphatidylcholine (PC), triacylglycerol (TG) and cholesteryl ester (CE) were significantly altered to reflect the FA composition of the diet whereas the composition of sphingomyelin (SM) and ceramides were generally unaffected.\n**CONCLUSION:** Results from this study indicate that the HDL lipidome is widely remodeled within 4 days of diet change and that certain lipid classes are more sensitive markers of diet whereas other lipid classes are better indicators of non-dietary factors.","tags":[],"title":"The HDL lipidome is widely remodeled by fast food versus Mediterranean diet in 4 days.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lisa Sawrey-Kubicek","Chenghao Zhu","Allison S Bardagjy","Christopher H Rhodes","Romina Sacchi","Jody M Randolph","Francene M Steinberg","Angela M Zivkovic"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1562457600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562457600,"objectID":"941d54df1e4715fdf98b9e77b89a52f3","permalink":"https://www.chenghaozhu.net/cv/publication/sawrey-kubicek-2019-egg/","publishdate":"2019-07-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/cv/publication/sawrey-kubicek-2019-egg/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Whole egg consumption compared with yolk-free egg increases the cholesterol efflux capacity of high-density lipoproteins in overweight, postmenopausal women.","type":"publication"}]
